						<h4>Mudaraba NRB Savings Bond (MNSB) Scheme</h4>
						<p>It is an undergoing fact that foreign remittances have been contributing a key role in the country's GDP & Foreign Currency reserve, but it is also true that major portion of the earnings of expatriates are utilized in unproductive sectors, consequent upon which the nation as a whole is not getting expected benefit therefrom. In case, we allow special privilege/incentive to the expatriates, they may be encouraged to send their remittances through banking channel and save their hard earned money with us in their deposit accounts. Their savings may help formation of capital which may be invested in the trade, commerce and industrial sectors and thereby it may contribute towards the growth and development of the country. With this objective in view, the Management has approved a new deposit product in the name of 'Mudaraba NRB Savings Bond'.</p>
